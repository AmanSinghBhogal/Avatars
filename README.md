## About Avatar:
Avatar: The Last Airbender, also known as Avatar: The Legend of Aang in some regions, is an American anime-influenced animated television series produced by Nickelodeon Animation Studios. This is my very first Next.js application, I had been working with React.js for quite some time now and wanted to try out Next.js, so as an hands on learing experience I made this app.
